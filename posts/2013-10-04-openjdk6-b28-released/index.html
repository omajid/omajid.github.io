<p>On October 4, 2013, the <a href="https://java.net/projects/openjdk6/downloads/download/openjdk-6-src-b28-04_oct_2013.tar.gz" title="OpenJDK6 b28">OpenJDK6 b28 source bundle</a> was published at <a href="https://java.net/projects/openjdk6/downloads/">https://java.net/projects/openjdk6/downloads/</a>.</p>
<p>This includes all the security patches since the b27 release as well as <a href="http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jdk6-dev/2013-September/003039.html">a major version bump in hotspot to hs23</a>. A <a href="https://openjdk6.java.net/OpenJDK6-B28-Changes.html">complete list of changes is available</a> too.</p>
<p>The test results were not ideal.</p>
<p>The TCK failed, with all issues basically boiling down to limited cryptography support. There are <a href="http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/security-dev/2008-August/000283.html">patches available to fix this</a>. As far as I can tell this is not a regression.</p>
<p>The jtreg tests did not pass cleanly either. Most of the failures were caused
by tests trying to access &ldquo;javaweb.sfbay.sun.com&rdquo;, which is not accessible
(from outside Oracle?). Some issues were caused by tests having a <code>@build</code> tag
but no <code>@run</code> tag (perhaps older jtreg versions were more lenient). Two new
tests, introduced by the 2013-04-16 security update,
<code>java/beans/Introspector/7064279/Test7064279.java</code> and
<code>java/beans/Introspector/Test5102804.java</code> both failed.</p>
<p>A special thanks to Andrew Hughes for all his contributions (especially with
the hotspot 23 backport) and to Pavel Tisnovsky for testing.</p>
<p>Onwards to B29!</p>
