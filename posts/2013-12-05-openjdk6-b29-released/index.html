The TCK failed, with all issues again basically boiling down to limited cryptography support. There are patches available to fix this. As far as I can tell this is not a regression." />

<p>On December 5, 2013, the <a href="https://java.net/projects/openjdk6/downloads/download/openjdk-6-src-b29-05_dec_2013.tar.gz" title="OpenJDK6 b29">OpenJDK6 b29 source bundle</a> was published at <a href="https://java.net/projects/openjdk6/downloads/">https://java.net/projects/openjdk6/downloads/</a>.</p>
<p>This is a security bugfix release that includes all the security patches since the b28 release. A <a href="https://openjdk6.java.net/OpenJDK6-B29-Changes.html">complete list of changes is available</a> too.</p>
<p>The test results were not ideal.</p>
<p>The TCK failed, with all issues again basically boiling down to limited cryptography support. There are <a href="http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/security-dev/2008-August/000283.html">patches available to fix this</a>. As far as I can tell this is not a regression.</p>
<p>The jtreg tests did not pass cleanly either.</p>
<p>A special thanks to <a href="http://blog.fuseyism.com/">Andrew Hughes</a> for backporting all the security fixes to OpenJDK6.</p>
<p>Onwards to B30!</p>
