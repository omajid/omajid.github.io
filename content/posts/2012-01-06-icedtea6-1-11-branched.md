I have just branched [IcedTea6 1.11](http://icedtea.classpath.org/hg/release/icedtea6-1.11/). Please start subjecting this branch to the most vicious tests you have.

I am planning to release IcedTea6 1.11 on Wednesday 2012-01-18, unless major problems are discovered. As always, a list of new features in this release can be found in the [NEWS file](http://icedtea.classpath.org/hg/release/icedtea6-1.11/file/tip/NEWS).

Only bugfixes are likely to be accepted for the branch. Please try to minimize
changes and hold off any build-system related changes unless they are
absolutely necessary.

Please note that all commits to this branch need to be posted for discussion
and have to be approved for committing.
