Or, how to deal with `error:0E07607: configuration file routines`....

TLDR:

```sh
# Only for .NET 5 or .NET Core 3.1
sudo dnf install -y compat-openssl11
export OPENSSL_CONF=/etc/pki/openssl11.cnf
dotnet whatever
```

# Introduction

How do you get .NET applications - whether the SDK/runtime itself or a
self-contained application - working on RHEL 9?

Generally, this should be a walk in the park. .NET is a cross platform
runtime. It explicitly supports RHEL. There shouldn't be any surprises
here.

Unfortunately, RHEL 9 (or CentOS Stream 9, rather) is still in
development. It has also switched to OpenSSL 3.0, which
currently-released versions of .NET don't support. Even forcing
OpenSSL 1.1 leads to an obscure `error:0E07607: configuration file
routines` error.

In the rest of this post, I will walk you through running a simple
.NET Core network-using application on CentOS Stream 9. I will be
using container images, but only because it makes things easier to
reproduce. There's nothing here that's specific to container images.

# CentOS Stream? Why not RHEL 9?

CentOS Stream 9 is the in-development version of what will eventually
become RHEL 9. You can [find more details about how RHEL 9 and CentOS
Stream 9 relate
here](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/faq-centos-stream-updates). I am
going to use CentOS Stream 9 in the rest of this post.

First, let's get our hands on a container we can use for trying things
out. I am going to use the latest CentOS Stream 9 image:
`quay.io/centos/centos:stream9-development`. [Other CentOS images are
available too](https://quay.io/repository/centos/centos?tab=tags). If
you are wondering, these images are [official images created by the
CentOS Stream
folks](https://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-announce/2021-March/048282.html).

I will use `podman` through this post. Feel free to replace the
`podman` command with `docker` if you want. The `podman` and `docker`
commands accept the same set of sub-commands and arguments. There
shouldn't be a function difference b

This image claims it's CentOS Stream 9, and even tells us that it
should reflect the next release of RHEL 9:

```shell
$ podman run -it quay.io/centos/centos:stream9-development cat /etc/os-release
NAME="CentOS Stream"
VERSION="9"
ID="centos"
ID_LIKE="rhel fedora"
VERSION_ID="9"
PLATFORM_ID="platform:el9"
PRETTY_NAME="CentOS Stream 9"
ANSI_COLOR="0;31"
CPE_NAME="cpe:/o:centos:centos:9"
HOME_URL="https://centos.org/"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/"
REDHAT_SUPPORT_PRODUCT="Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9"
REDHAT_SUPPORT_PRODUCT_VERSION="CentOS Stream"
```

# Install and Use .NET Core

Let's start with a simple `Dockerfile`. We will use this to write and
run a trivial .NET Core 3.1 application:

```Dockerfile
FROM quay.io/centos/centos:stream9-development

RUN dnf install -yq wget libicu openssl

RUN wget -q --no-check-certificate https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh && \
    bash dotnet-install.sh && \
    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet/ && \
    dotnet new console -o /app
```

Here's what this `Dockerfile` does, line by line.

1. Use the CentOS Stream 9 container image
2. Install some dependencies
   - `wget` is needed to download .NET Core itself
   - `libicu` and `openssl` are required .NET Core dependencies
3. Get the .NET Core installation script (`dotnet-install.sh`)
4. Use the installation script to install .NET Core 3.1, which
   installs it to `~/.dotnet` (the same as `$HOME/.dotnet`)
5. Update `$PATH` to include the new .NET installation directory, to
   make future invocations of `dotnet` work.
6. Create a new Hello-World application at `/app`.


Now, let's build this `Dockerfile`:

```shell
$ podman build --tag centos-dotnet-container --file Dockerfile
STEP 1: FROM quay.io/centos/centos:stream9-development

```

As you can see, this fails to work with a `No usable version of libssl
was found`. `libssl` is a part of OpenSSL. This message means that
.NET couldn't find a version of OpenSSL that it could use.

# Switch to OpenSSL 1.1

If you check the container, it has OpenSSL 3.0 already installed:

```bash
$ podman run -it quay.io/centos/centos:stream9-development rpm -q openssl-libs
openssl-libs-3.0.0-0.beta2.6.el9.x86_64
```

Does that mean .NET doesn't know how to make use of that?

Yes. It turns out .NET Core 3.1 and .NET 5.0 only know how to make use
of OpenSSL 1.0 and 1.1. [Support for OpenSSL 3.0 will be included in
.NET 6 and later.](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/46526)

So let's install OpenSSL 1.1, which .NET Core 3.1 can use.

The CentOS Stream 9 package for OpenSSL 1.1 is called
`compat-openssl11`. Due to a bug, it's not currently available in the
CentOS Stream 9 package repositories. It should be available soon. For
now, we will work around that by manually getting the package and
installing it.

```Dockerfile
FROM quay.io/centos/centos:stream9-development

RUN dnf install -yq wget libicu openssl

# This is the correct method once the issue is fixed: RUN dnf install -y compat-openssl11
# This next line is the workaround:
RUN wget -q --no-check-certificate https://kojihub.stream.rdu2.redhat.com/kojifiles/packages/compat-openssl11/1.1.1k/2.el9/x86_64/compat-openssl11-1.1.1k-2.el9.x86_64.rpm && dnf install -yq ./compat-openssl11*.rpm

RUN wget -q --no-check-certificate https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh && \
    bash dotnet-install.sh && \
    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet/ && \
    dotnet new console -o /app && \
    cd /app && \
    dotnet run
```

Running this should get us a working hello world:

```shell
$ podman build --tag centos-dotnet-container --file Dockerfile
STEP 1: FROM quay.io/centos/centos:stream9-development
STEP 2: RUN dnf install -yq wget libicu openssl
STEP 3: RUN wget -q --no-check-certificate https://kojihub.stream.rdu2.redhat.com/kojifiles/packages/compat-openssl11/1.1.1k/2.el9/x86_64/compat-openssl11-1.1.1k-2.el9.x86_64.rpm && dnf install -yq ./compat-openssl11*.rpm
STEP 4: RUN wget -q --no-check-certificate https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh &&     bash dotnet-install.sh &&     export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet/ &&     dotnet new console -o /app &&     cd /app &&     dotnet run

# Is OpenSSL 1.1 Actually Working?

The error messages about `libssl` not being found have gone away. But
we haven't actually used any networking or cryptographic features. At
this point, we don't actually know if OpenSSL support in .NET is functional.

We can confirm, at least to certain extent, that .NET is working with
OpenSSL with this trivial program at `Program.cs`.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static readonly HttpClient client = new HttpClient();

    static async Task Main()
    {
        try
        {
            string response = await client.GetStringAsync("http://dot.net/");
            Console.WriteLine($"Got {response.Length} bytes");
        }
        catch (HttpRequestException e)
        {
            Console.Error.WriteLine(e.ToString());
        }
    }
}
```

This program is based on the [HttpClient
sample](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient?view=net-5.0#examples).
It simply connects to https://dot.net/ and gets the contents of
returned by that URL as a `string`.

Since the URL is an `https` resource, it ends up using a large part of
the cryptographic stack of .NET, much of which is using the underlying
OpenSSL library on Linux. In other words, if we can access this URL,
we can safely assume that a large number of cryptographic features
in OpenSSL can be correctly used by our .NET runtime.

Let's add this into our application through our `Dockerfile`.

```Dockerfile
FROM quay.io/centos/centos:stream9-development

RUN dnf install -yq wget libicu openssl

# This is the correct method once the issue is fixed: RUN dnf install -y compat-openssl11
# This next line is the workaround:
RUN wget -q --no-check-certificate https://kojihub.stream.rdu2.redhat.com/kojifiles/packages/compat-openssl11/1.1.1k/2.el9/x86_64/compat-openssl11-1.1.1k-2.el9.x86_64.rpm && dnf install -yq ./compat-openssl11*.rpm

RUN wget -q --no-check-certificate https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh && \
    bash dotnet-install.sh && \
    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet/ && \
    dotnet new console -o /app

ADD Program.cs /app/

CMD cd /app && \
    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet/ && \
    dotnet run
```

Then, we can build it.

```shell
$ podman build --tag centos-dotnet-container --file Dockerfile
... SNIP ...
STEP 7: COMMIT centos-dotnet-container

e6f6459a92eb673c4d869790584d27ecdbb84d085aff562df3b9271d81f9ffd4
```

Finally, we run our application:

```shell
$ podman run -it centos-dotnet-container
System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: The SSL connection could not be established, see inner exception.
 ---> System.Security.Authentication.AuthenticationException: Authentication failed, see inner exception.

 ... SNIP ...
   at System.Net.Http.HttpClient.GetStringAsyncCore(Task`1 getTask)
   at Program.Main() in /app/Program.cs:line 13
```

Well, that's certainly not an error I had ever seen before.

A quick google for `0E076071` brings us to
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/27792. My take away from that
discussion is that an `unknown module name` error basically means that
the current version of OpenSSL can not parse the OpenSSL configuration
file (located at `/etc/pki/tls/openssl.cnf` for CentOS Stream 9). We
need to use a different OpenSSL version, or use a different
configuration file.

Following the advice from
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1694850, we should
override the default and unusable configuration with a configuration
usable by OpenSSL 1.1.

If we look for all `.cnf` files owned/installed by the
`compat-openssl11` package, we can find where a usable configuration
file is:

```shell
$ podman run -it centos-dotnet-container rpm -ql compat-openssl11 | grep cnf
/etc/pki/openssl11.cnf
```

Then we can modify our `Dockerfile` to `export
OPENSSL_CONF=/etc/pki/openssl11.cnf` to override the default OpenSSL
1.1 configuration:

```Dockerfile
FROM quay.io/centos/centos:stream9-development

RUN dnf install -yq wget libicu openssl

# This is the correct method once the issue is fixed: RUN dnf install -y compat-openssl11
# This next line is the workaround:
RUN wget -q --no-check-certificate https://kojihub.stream.rdu2.redhat.com/kojifiles/packages/compat-openssl11/1.1.1k/2.el9/x86_64/compat-openssl11-1.1.1k-2.el9.x86_64.rpm && dnf install -yq ./compat-openssl11*.rpm

RUN wget -q --no-check-certificate https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh && \
    bash dotnet-install.sh && \
    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet/ && \
    dotnet new console -o /app

ADD Program.cs /app/

CMD cd /app && \
    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet/ && \
    export OPENSSL_CONF=/etc/pki/openssl11.cnf && \
    dotnet run
```

Now, let's build and run it one last time.

```shell
$ podman build --tag centos-dotnet-container --file Dockerfile
STEP 1: FROM quay.io/centos/centos:stream9-development
STEP 2: RUN dnf install -yq wget libicu openssl
STEP 3: RUN wget -q --no-check-certificate https://kojihub.stream.rdu2.redhat.com/kojifiles/packages/compat-openssl11/1.1.1k/2.el9/x86_64/compat-openssl11-1.1.1k-2.el9.x86_64.rpm && dnf install -yq ./compat-openssl11*.rpm
STEP 4: RUN wget -q --no-check-certificate https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh &&     bash dotnet-install.sh &&     export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet/ &&     dotnet new console -o /app
STEP 5: ADD Program.cs /app/
STEP 6: CMD cd /app &&     export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet/ &&     export OPENSSL_CONF=/etc/pki/openssl11.cnf &&     dotnet run
STEP 7: COMMIT centos-dotnet-container
$ podman run -it centos-dotnet-container
Got 61174 bytes
```

Finally, it all works!

# What's next

To summarize, running .NET Core 3.1 (and .NET 5) on CentOS Stream 9
involves 2 main steps:

- Installing OpenSSL 1.1
- Forcing .NET to use OpenSSL 1.1's configuration file instead of the
  default OpenSSL configuration

Now that you know how to work around things, you can figure out how to
get older .NET applications running on RHEL 9, including standalone
applications.

.NET 6, which is on the horizon, will support OpenSSL 3.0 natively and
will not need any of the workarounds we had to resort to.

That's just one of the reasons to get excited about .NET 6. Download
.NET 6 today and try it out on your favourite Linux distribution!

And of course, like previous versions of .NET, .NET 6 will be
available in CentOS Stream 9 as `dotnet-sdk-6.0` at some point in the
future.
