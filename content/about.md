Hi, I am Omair Majid.

I am a Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat who works with open
source languages, runtimes and projects like [.NET
Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core) and
[OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/).

I am passionate about making sure these runtimes are well-maintained,
secure, perform well, and stay compatible with the rest of the
ecosystem on Linux, whether it's in the context of containers running
in the cloud (such as Kubernetes and OpenShift) or bare-metal.

I am a package maintainer in [Fedora](http://www.fedoraproject.org). I
am also a member of the [Fedora .NET Special Interest Group
(SIG)](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/DotNet); I maintain .NET
Core packages in Fedora as part of the SIG. I am also the current
maintainer of some packages in [Red Hat Enterprise
Linux](http://www.redhat.com/rhel/).

All opinions are my own. They may or may not reflect the opinions of
any employers (past, present or future).
