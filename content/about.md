Hi, I am Omair. I am a [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com) developer who spends most of his time contributing to [IcedTea](http://icedtea.classpath.org), [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/) and related open source projects. I am also quite a bit involved with [Fedora](http://www.fedoraproject.org) and [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](http://www.redhat.com/rhel/) development as well.  
  
I normally hang out on irc: #openjdk on irc.oftc.net and #fedora-java on
irc.freenode.net.
