Hi, I am Omair Majid. I am a software engineer who works with open
source languages, runtimes and projects like [.NET
Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core) and
[OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/). I am passionate about making sure
these runtimes are well-maintained, secure, perform well, and stay
compatible with the rest of the ecosystem on Linux, whether it's
bare-metal or in the form of containers.

I am a package maintainer in [Fedora](http://www.fedoraproject.org). I
am part of the [Fedora .NET Special Interest
Group](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/DotNet). I am also the
current maintainer of several packages in [Red Hat Enterprise
Linux](http://www.redhat.com/rhel/).

All opinions are my own. They may or may not reflect the opinions of
any employers (past, present or future).
